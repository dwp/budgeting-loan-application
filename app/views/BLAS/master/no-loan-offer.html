          <p>You applied for a Budgeting Loan of <strong>&pound;<span class="loan-amount">{{ data['loan-amount'] }}</span></strong> on <span class="date"></span>.</p>

          <p>Based on the information we have, we cannot offer you a Budgeting Loan at this time.</p>

          <p>This is because:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you have already borrowed as much as you can in other Budgeting Loans or Crisis Loans</li>
            <!-- <li>you do not receive a benefit that would make you eligible</li>
            <li>you have not received benefits that would make you eligible for 6 months</li>
            <li>you and your partner have savings of £[X] which we have decided are enough to pay for what you need</li>
            <li>we cannot offer you more than the minimum amount of £100</li> -->
          </ul>

          <p>You can apply again in future if you become <a href="https://www.gov.uk/budgeting-help-benefits/eligibility">eligible</a>.</p>
