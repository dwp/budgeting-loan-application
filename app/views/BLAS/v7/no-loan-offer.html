          <p>You applied for a Budgeting Loan of £[amount] on [date].</p>

          <p>We cannot offer you a Budgeting Loan at this time.</p>

          <p>This is because:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you’ve not received a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/budgeting-help-benefits/eligibility">benefit that makes you eligible</a> for 6 months</li>
            <li>you owe more than £1,500 in total for Budgeting Loans and Crisis Loans</li>
            <li>you [and your partner] have savings of over £[amount], which we have decided are enough to pay for what you need</li>
            <li>we cannot offer you more than £100, which is the lowest amount you can borrow</li>
{#             <li>we cannot pay people who are involved in a trade dispute</li> #}
